# daily-planner

## Description
This application acts as a simple workday planner. It allows the user to plan their day, save that information, and look at that same information later on. The planner is color coded to show whether the event is taking place in the future, present, or has already passed. It was made using jQuery, JS, HTML, and the DayJS library for accurate time representation. It was my first time working with DayJS, so getting everything synced up just right took some work.

## How To Use
The planner is broken down from a 9-5 work day into hour blocks of time. The user is able to fill out the hour block with whatever may need to be accomplished during that time. Click the save button, and you're good to go. The table is color coded to help you prioritize your day.
